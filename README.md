## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to use AI and open source technology to help poor farmers in India grow the best crops and fertilize like a pro. Our tool provides reliable and accessible recommendations based on local soil and weather conditions, helping farmers optimize their crop yields and improve their economic livelihoods.

By using open source technologies, we also hope to foster a community of farmers and developers who can collaborate and continuously improve the accuracy and utility of the tool. Let's use the power of AI and open source principles to empower poor farmers in India and beyond!

## Project Workflow
Below are some of the stages of this project for sucessfull development and deployment of both frontend and backend services.

- Data Collection & ML model training
- Backend Deployment of ML model API's
- Frontend Interface with 3D model
- Deployment of Frontend on Vercel
